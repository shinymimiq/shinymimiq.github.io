## Original Plan

It has been a half month past since the start of 2015. My plan for 2014 seems has been finished OKay, though there is an important one didn't finished. Actually it's my first time to review my annual plan, thus things should be getting better anyway.

In 2014, the most cheerful achievement should be that I finally got an good offer for work: a small IT company with great products. Also before that I was survived from Imperial College! Yeah!

Yes now I'm a software engineering, who will focusing on imporve and maintain compiler for our company. Thus this year's reading list would add a lot technique books such as _Data Structures and Algorithm_, _C++ Primer_, _Code Complete_, _Compilers: Principles, Techniques & Tools_

Besides, I shall work hard for the oppourtunity to rotation to UK, and keep hardworking, looking for time to prepare GRE maybe.

That's it.

## Review at the end of March

### Changes of Learning Target:
_Compilers_ This will be put in the low priority.
*SystemC* Need more time on learning this.

### Languages:
Also I started to learn Japanese online, current plan is to take the exam on December or next year's July, for level N2. Good luck to me.
